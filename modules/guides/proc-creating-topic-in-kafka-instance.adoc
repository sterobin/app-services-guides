= Creating a topic in your Kafka instance

[role="_abstract"]
In the previous step of this tutorial, you created an example OpenShift application. The application is a Quarkus application that uses a Kafka topic called `prices` to produce and consume messages. In this step, you create the `prices` topic in your Kafka instance so that the Quarkus application can interact with it.

.Prerequisites
* You've completed the previous steps in this tutorial:
** link:{base-url}{service-binding-url}#proc-verifying-connection-to-openshift-cluster_{context}[Verifying connection to your OpenShift cluster]
** link:{base-url}{service-binding-url}#proc-connecting-kafka-instance-to-openshift-cluster_{context}[Connecting a Kafka instance to your OpenShift cluster]
** link:{base-url}{service-binding-url}#proc-deploying-example-application-in-openshift_{context}[Deploying an example application in OpenShift]
* Youâ€™ve created a Kafka instance in {product} and the instance is in the *Ready* state. To learn how to create a Kafka instance, see link:{base-url}{getting-started-url}[Getting started with {product-long}^].

.Procedure
. On the link:{service-url}[Kafka Instances^] page of the {product} web console, click the name of the Kafka instance that you want to add a topic to.

. Click *Create topic* and follow the guided steps to define the details of the `prices` topic. Click *Next* to complete each step and click *Finish* to complete the setup.

.Guided steps to define topic

*Topic name*:: Enter `prices` as the topic name.
*Partitions*:: Set the number of partitions for this topic. For this tutorial, set a value of `1`. Partitions are distinct lists of messages within a topic and enable parts of a topic to be distributed over multiple brokers in the cluster. A topic can contain one or more partitions, enabling producer and consumer loads to be scaled.
+
NOTE: You can increase the number of partitions later, but you cannot decrease them.
+
*Message retention*:: Set the message retention time to the relevant value and increment. For this tutorial, set a value of `7 days`. Message retention time is the amount of time that messages are retained in a topic before they are deleted or compacted, depending on the cleanup policy.
*Replicas*:: For this release of {product}, the replicas are preconfigured. The number of partition replicas for the topic is set to `3` and the minimum number of follower replicas that must be in sync with a partition leader is set to `2`. Replicas are copies of partitions in a topic. Partition replicas are distributed over multiple brokers in the cluster to ensure topic availability if a broker fails. When a follower replica is in sync with a partition leader, the follower replica can become the new partition leader if needed.
+
After you complete the topic setup, the new Kafka topic is listed in the topics table.
