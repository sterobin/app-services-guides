= Configuring the Node.js example application to connect to a Kafka instance
:imagesdir: ../_images

To enable your Node.js application to access a Kafka instance, you must configure a connection by specifying the following details:

* The bootstrap server endpoint for your Kafka instance
* The generated credentials for your {product} service account
* The Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) mechanism that the client will use to authenticate with the Kafka instance

In this task, you'll create a new configuration file called `.env`. In this file, you'll set the required bootstrap server and client credentials as environment variables.

.Prerequisites
ifndef::qs[]
* You have the bootstrap server endpoint and the generated credentials for your service account. You copied this information previously for the Kafka instance in {product} by selecting the options menu (three vertical dots) and clicking *Connection*.
endif::[]

.Procedure

. In your IDE, create a new file. Save the file with the name `.env`, at the root level of the `reactive-example` directory for the cloned repository.

. In the `.env` file, add the lines shown in the example. These lines set the bootstrap server and client credentials as environment variables to be used by the Node.js application.

----
KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVER=__<bootstrap_server>__
KAFKA_CLIENT_ID=__<client_id>__
KAFKA_CLIENT_SECRET=__<client_secret>__
KAFKA_SASL_MECHANISM=plain
----

In the preceding example, replace the values in angle brackets (`< >`) with your own bootstrap server and client credential information.
ifdef::qs[]
+
The values are described as follows:
+
--
* *bootstrap_server*: The bootstrap server endpoint for your Kafka instance. To access this information for a Kafka instance in {product}, select the options menu (three vertical dots). Click *Connection*.
* *client_id*: A client credential generated when you create a service account in {product}. You're prompted to copy and store this credential when you create the service account.
* *client_secret*: A client credential generated when you create a service account in {product}. You're prompted to copy and store this credential when you create the service account.
--
endif::[]
+
In this case, observe that the Node.js application uses the `SASL/PLAIN` authentication method (that is, the value of `KAFKA_SASL_MECHANISM` is set to `plain`). This means that the application uses only the client ID and client secret to authenticate with the Kafka instance. The application doesn't require an authentication token.

. Save the `.env` file.

ifdef::qs[]
.Verification
* Did you set environment variables for the Kafka instance?
