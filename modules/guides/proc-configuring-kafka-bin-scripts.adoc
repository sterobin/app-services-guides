= Configuring the Kafka bin scripts to connect to a Kafka instance
:imagesdir: ../_images

To enable the Kafka bin scripts to access a Kafka instance, you must configure the connection using the generated credentials for your {product} service account. For the Kafka bin scripts, you will create a configuration file that defines these values.

.Prerequisites
ifndef::qs[]
* You have the generated credentials for your service account. You copied this information previously for the Kafka instance in {product} by selecting the options menu (three vertical dots), clicking *View connection information*, and creating the service account.
endif::[]

.Procedure

. In your Kafka distribution, navigate to the `config/` directory.

. Create a file called `{property-file-name}`.

. In the `{property-file-name}` file, add the following content to set the Kafka instance client credentials. Replace the values with your own server and credential information.

ifdef::qs[]
The `<client_id>` and `<client_secret>` are the generated credentials for your service account. You copied this information previously for the Kafka instance in {product} by selecting the options menu (three vertical dots), clicking *View connection information*, and creating the service account.
endif::[]

sasl.mechanism=PLAIN
security.protocol=SASL_SSL

sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule required \
  username="__<client_id>__" \
  password="__<client_secret>__";
----

NOTE: {product} also supports the SASL/OAUTHBEARER mechanism for authentication, which is the recommended authentication mechanism to use. However, the Kafka bin scripts do not yet fully support OAUTHBEARER, so this example uses SASL/PLAIN.

. Save the file. You will use it in the next task to connect to your Kafka instance and produce messages.
