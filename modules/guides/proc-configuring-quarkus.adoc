= Configuring the Quarkus example application to connect to a Kafka instance
:imagesdir: ../_images

To enable your Quarkus application to access a Kafka instance, configure the connection using the bootstrap server endpoint, the generated credentials for your {product} service account, and the SASL/OAUTHBEARER token endpoint for the Kafka instance. For Quarkus, you can configure connection information by using the `application.properties` configuration file. The example in this task sets environment variables and then references them in the  `application.properties` file.

Quarkus applications use https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-reactive-messaging[MicroProfile Reactive Messaging^] to produce messages to and consume messages from your Kafka instances in {product}. For more information about Quarkus configuration options for Kafka and Reactive Messaging, see https://quarkus.io/guides/kafka[Using Apache Kafka with Reactive Messaging^] in the Quarkus documentation.

.Prerequisites
ifndef::qs[]
* You have the bootstrap server endpoint and the SASL/OAUTHBEARER token endpoint for the Kafka instance. To relocate the server endpoint and the SASL/OAUTHBEARER token endpoint, select your Kafka instance in the {product} web console, select the options menu (three vertical dots), and click *Connection*.
* You have the generated credentials for your service account. To regenerate the credentials, use the *Service Accounts* page in the {product} web console to find your service account and update the credentials.
* You've set the permissions for your service account to access the Kafka instance resources. To verify the current permissions, select your Kafka instance in the {product} web console and use the *Access* page to find your service account permission settings.
endif::[]

.Procedure
. On the command line, set the Kafka instance bootstrap server and client credentials as environment variables to be used by Quarkus or other applications. Replace the values with your own server and credential information.

ifdef::qs[]
The `<bootstrap_server>` is the bootstrap server endpoint for your Kafka instance. The `<oauth_token_endpoint_uri>` is the SASL/OAUTHBEARER token endpoint for the Kafka instance. The `<client_id>` and `<client_secret>` are the generated credentials for your service account. You copied this information previously for the Kafka instance in {product} by selecting the options menu (three vertical dots) and clicking *Connection*.

.Setting environment variables for server and credentials
[source,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ export BOOTSTRAP_SERVER=__<bootstrap_server>__
$ export CLIENT_ID=__<client_id>__
$ export CLIENT_SECRET=__<client_secret>__
$ export OAUTH_TOKEN_ENDPOINT_URI=__<oauth_token_endpoint_uri>__
----

. In the Quarkus example application, review the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file to understand how the environment variables you set in the previous step are used in your application. This example uses the `dev` configuration profile in the `application.properties` file.

ifdef::qs[]
.Verification
* Did you set environment variables for the Kafka instance?
