After you install the RHOAS Operator, you can verify that the Operator is working by using the RHOAS CLI to connect to your OpenShift cluster and retrieve the cluster status. The following example shows how to verify connection to your OpenShift cluster.

.Prerequisites
* The RHOAS Operator is installed on your OpenShift cluster. See link:{base-url}{service-binding-url}#proc-installing-rhoas-operator_{context}[Installing the RHOAS Operator on OpenShift].
* You can access your OpenShift cluster with privileges to create a new project.
* You've installed the OpenShift CLI. For more information, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.8/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html#installing-openshift-cli[Installing the OpenShift CLI^].
* You've installed the latest version of the RHOAS CLI. For more information, see link:{base-url}{rhoas-cli-url}[Installing the RHOAS CLI^].

.Procedure
. On your computer, open a command-line window.
. Log in to the OpenShift CLI using a token.
.. Log in to the OpenShift web console as a user who has privileges to create a new project in the cluster.
.. In the upper-right corner of the console, next to your user name, click the drop-down menu. Select *Copy login command*.
+
A new page opens.
.. Click the *Display Token* link.
.. In the section entitled *Log in with this token*, copy the full `oc login` command shown.
.. On the command line, paste the login command you copied. Right-click on the command line and select *Paste*.
+
You see output confirming that you're logged in to your OpenShift cluster and the current project that you're using.

. On the command line, create a new project, as shown in the following example.
