= Creating a new registry instance and matching schema for a topic
:imagesdir: ../_images

[role="_abstract"]
The following procedure shows how to use {product} web console to select a Kafka topic, and then create a new {registry} instance with a value or key schema that matches the topic.

Alternatively, to learn how to check an _existing_ {registry} instance for schemas that match a topic, see {base-url}{topic-config-url}#proc-checking-schema-matches-for-topic_{context}[Checking existing schema matches for a topic].

.Prerequisites
* You're logged in to the {product} web console.
* You've created a Kafka instance with at least one Kafka topic in {product}. To learn how to do this, see {base-url}{getting-started-url}[Getting started with {product-long}^].
* You understand how to create a {registry} instance and upload a schema to be used by client applications. To learn how to do this, see {base-url}{getting-started-service-registry-url}[Getting started with {registry}^].

.Procedure
. In the {product} web console, go to *Streams for Apache Kafka* > *Kafka Instances*. Click the name of the Kafka instance that contains the topic that you want to check for matching schemas in {registry}.
. On the *Topics* page, click the name of the topic that you want to check.
. Click the *Schemas* tab.
. Based on what the *Schemas* tab shows, start creating a new {registry} instance using one of these options:
+
--
** If there are no existing {registry} instances in your organization, the drop-down menu is empty and the *Schemas* tab displays `No {registry} instances`.
+
For the type of schema that you want to associate with your topic, copy the required naming format shown on the *Schemas* tab. To start creating a new {registry} instance and schema, click *Go to {registry}*.

** Even if there are existing {registry} instances in the drop-down menu, you can still create and select a new instance.
+
Before you start, take note of your topic name. To match the topic, the ID of a schema that you add to a new {registry} instance must be in the format of `_<topic-name>_-value`, or  `_<topic-name>_-key`. When you're ready to start creating a new {registry} instance and schema, below the drop-down menu, click *Create {registry} instance*.
--
+
The {registry} section of the web console opens.

. On the *{registry}* page, click *Create {registry} instance*. Follow the instructions in the resulting dialog box to create a new instance.
. To create a new schema, select your new {registry} instance and then click *Upload artifact*.
. In the `ID of the artifact` field, specify a schema ID in the format of `_<topic-name>_-value`, or  `_<topic-name>_-key`. If you previously copied this required naming format, you can paste it in the `ID of the artifact` field.
. Finish creating the schema in the normal way.
. When you have finished creating the new {registry} instance and schema, in the web console, click *Streams for Apache Kafka*. Navigate to the *Schemas* tab for your topic, as you did previously.
. In the *{registry} instance* drop-down menu, select the new {registry} instance that you created.
+
The *Schemas* tab shows the name of the schema that you uploaded when you created the new {registry} instance.
. To see details for the schema, or to manage it, click *View details*.
