= Running the Quarkus example application
:imagesdir: ../_images

After you configure your Quarkus application to connect to a Kafka instance and you create the Kafka topic, you can run the Quarkus application to start producing and consuming messages to and from the topic.

The Quarkus example application in this quick start has three application-scoped Java classes:

* One class generates a random number between 0 and 100 and produces it to a Kafka topic.
* Another class consumes the number from the Kafka topic.
* A final class exposes the number as a REST UI (using Server Sent events).

.Prerequisites
* You've configured the Quarkus example application to connect to the Kafka instance.
* You've created the `prices` example Kafka topic.

.Procedure
. On the command line, navigate to the `code-examples/quarkus-kafka-quickstart` directory that you imported and run the Quarkus example application in developer mode.
+
.Running the Quarkus example application
[source]
----
$ cd ~/code-examples/quarkus-kafka-quickstart
$ ./mvnw quarkus:dev
----
. After the application is running, in a web browser, go to http://localhost:8080/prices.html[^] and verify that the `Last price` is updated.
+
If the Quarkus application fails to run, review the error log in the terminal and address any problems. Also review the steps in this quick start to ensure that the Quarkus application and Kafka topic are configured correctly.

.Verification
* Did the Quarkus example application run without any errors?
* At http://localhost:8080/prices.html[^], is the `Last price` updated?
