You can use the `kafka-console-consumer` script to consume messages from Kafka topics. This example consumes the messages that you sent previously with the producer that you created with the `kafka-console-producer` script.

.Prerequisites

* You used the `kafka-console-producer` script to produce example messages to a topic.

.Procedure

. On the command line in a separate terminal from your producer, enter the following command to start the `kafka-console-consumer` script.

This example uses the SASL/PLAIN authentication mechanism with the credentials that you saved in the `{property-file-name}` file. This example consumes and displays the messages from the `my-other-topic` example topic.
