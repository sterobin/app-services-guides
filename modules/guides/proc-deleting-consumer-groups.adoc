= Deleting a consumer group
:imagesdir: ../_images

[role="_abstract"]
Use the {product} web console to delete consumer groups.
The consumer group must have no active members connected to a topic.
By deleting the consumer group, you remove the current state associated with the group.

As an alternative to using the {product} web console, you can use the `rhoas` command-line interface (CLI) to delete consumer groups, as shown in the following example command:

.Example CLI command to delete a consumer group
[source]
----
rhoas kafka consumer-group delete my-consumer-group
----

For a list of topic properties that you can update using the CLI, see the `rhoas kafka topic update` entry in the {base-url-cli}{rhoas-cli-ref-url}[_CLI command reference (rhoas)_^].

If you're using Kafka scripts, you can use the `kafka-consumer-groups.sh` tool to delete consumer groups:
[source,subs="+quotes,+attributes"]
----
./kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server __<bootstrap_server>__ --command-config __<authentication_properties>__ --delete --group my-consumer-group
----

.Prerequisites
* You're logged in to the {product} web console.
* The consumer group you select must have no active members.
* Consumers in the consumer group must be shut down (not consuming partitions).

.Procedure
. In the {product} web console, go to *Streams for Apache Kafka* > *Kafka Instances* and click the name of the Kafka instance that contains the consumer group you're updating.
+
Alternatively, select a consumer group for a specific topic.

--
.. In the {product} web console, go to *Streams for Apache Kafka* > *Kafka Instances* and click the name of the Kafka instance that contains the topic.
