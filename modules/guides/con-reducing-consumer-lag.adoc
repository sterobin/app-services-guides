Consumer lag for a given consumer group indicates the delay between the last message added in a partition and the message currently being picked up by that consumer.
The lag reflects the position of the consumer offset in relation to the end of the partition log.

When you're reviewing consumer group properties in the {product} web console, look for the differences between *Current offset* and *Log end offset*.
The difference shows as the *Offset lag* value.

For applications that rely on the processing of (near) real-time data, itâ€™s critical that consumer lag doesn't become too big.
Suppose a topic streams 100 messages per second.
A lag of 1000 messages between the producer offset (the topic partition head) and the last (current) offset that the consumer has read means a 10-second delay.
The offset lag shows that a gap is opening up between the write and read positions.

To reduce lag, you typically add new consumers to a group.
However, you can also increase the retention time for a message to remain in a topic.
Extending the retention of data in the log gives the consumer a chance to catch up before data is flushed from the message log.

For more information about increasing topic retention time, see {base-url}{topic-config-url}[_Configuring topics in {product}_^].
