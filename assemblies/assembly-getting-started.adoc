{product-long} is currently available for Development Preview. Development Preview releases provide early access to a limited set of features that might not be fully tested and that might change in the final GA version. Users should not use Development Preview software in production or for business-critical workloads. Limited documentation is available for Development Preview releases and is typically focused on fundamental user goals.

As a developer of applications and services, you can use {product-long} to create and set up Kafka instances and connect your applications and services to these instances. {product} is a managed cloud service that enables you to add Kafka data-streaming functionality in your applications without having to install, configure, run, and maintain your own Kafka clusters.

//For more overview information about {product}, see [variablized link to overview here https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_streams_for_apache_kafka/].

// Condition out QS-only content so that it doesn't appear in docs.
// All QS anchor IDs must be in this alternate anchor ID format `[#anchor-id]` because the ascii splitter relies on the other format `[id="anchor-id"]` to generate module files.
