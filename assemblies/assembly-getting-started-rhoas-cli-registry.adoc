With the `rhoas` command-line interface (CLI), you can manage OpenShift Service Registry from a terminal.

As a developer of applications and services,
you can use `rhoas` to create Service Registry instances and connect your applications and services to these instances.
You can also manage artifacts.
Artifacts are items stored in Service Registry, like schemas and API specifications.
