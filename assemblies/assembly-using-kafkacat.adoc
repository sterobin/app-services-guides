{product-long} is currently available for Development Preview. Development Preview releases provide early access to a limited set of features that might not be fully tested and that might change in the final GA version. Users should not use Development Preview software in production or for business-critical workloads. Limited documentation is available for Development Preview releases and is typically focused on fundamental user goals.

// Purpose statement for the assembly
[role="_abstract"]
As a developer of applications and services, you can use https://github.com/edenhill/kafkacat[Kafkacat^] to test and debug your Kafka instances in {product-long}. Kafkacat is a command-line utility for messaging in Apache Kafka 0.8 and later. With Kafkacat, you can produce and consume messages for your Kafka instances directly from the command line, and list topic and partition information for your Kafka instances.

//* You have a subscription to {product-long}. For more information about signing up, see *<@SME: Where to link?>*.
* You have a running Kafka instance in {product}.

// Condition out QS-only content so that it doesn't appear in docs.
// All QS anchor IDs must be in this alternate anchor ID format `[#anchor-id]` because the ascii splitter relies on the other format `[id="anchor-id"]` to generate module files.
