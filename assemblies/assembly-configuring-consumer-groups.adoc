// Purpose statement for the assembly
[role="_abstract"]
Consumer groups share large data streams generated by producers from a given topic in a Kafka instance.
Grouping consumers scales consumption to keep up with the rate of data produced.
Consumers within a group donâ€™t read data from the same partition, but can read data from one or more partitions.

As a developer of applications and services, you can view all the consumer groups that have access to a particular Kafka instance in {product}.
If required, use the {product} web console to reset the offsets of consumer groups or delete consumer groups.

As an alternative to using the {product} web console, you can use the `rhoas` command-line interface (CLI) or the Kafka `kafka-consumer-groups.sh` script to review and update consumer groups.
