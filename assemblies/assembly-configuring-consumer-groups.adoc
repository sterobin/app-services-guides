[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-long} is currently available for Development Preview. Development Preview releases provide early access to a limited set of features that might not be fully tested and that might change in the final GA version. Users should not use Development Preview software in production or for business-critical workloads. Limited documentation is available for Development Preview releases and is typically focused on fundamental user goals.

// Purpose statement for the assembly
[role="_abstract"]
Consumer groups share large data streams generated by producers from a given topic in a Kafka instance.
Grouping consumers scales consumption to keep up with the rate of data produced.
Consumers within a group donâ€™t read data from the same partition, but can read data from one or more partitions.

As a developer of applications and services, you can view all the consumer groups that have access to a particular Kafka instance in {product}.
If required, use the {product} web console to reset the offsets of consumer groups or delete consumer groups.

As an alternative to using the {product} web console, you can use the `rhoas` command-line interface (CLI) or the Kafka `kafka-consumer-groups.sh` script to review and update consumer groups.
