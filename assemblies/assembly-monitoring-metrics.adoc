// Purpose statement for the assembly
[role="_abstract"]
As a developer or administrator, you can view metrics in {product} to visualize the performance and data usage for Kafka instances and topics that you have access to. You can view metrics directly in the {product} web console, or use the metrics API endpoint provided by {product} to import the data into your own metrics monitoring tool, such as Prometheus.

//Additional line break to resolve mod docs generation error, not sure why. Leaving for now. (Stetson, 20 May 2021)
