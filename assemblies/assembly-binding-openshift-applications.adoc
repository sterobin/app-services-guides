As a developer of applications and services, you can connect applications deployed on a Kubernetes platform such as Red Hat OpenShift to Kafka instances created in {product-long}.

For example, suppose you have the following applications deployed on OpenShift:

* One application that publishes price updates for a variety of stocks
* A second application that consumes the price updates for publication on a web page

In addition, you have a Kafka instance in {product}. Each time the first application produces a price update, you want to use the Kafka instance to forward the update as an event to the second, consuming application.

To achieve this behavior, you need a way to connect the applications to your Kafka instance in {product}.

You can use a specialized Operator called the Service Binding Operator to automatically provide an application on Kubernetes with the parameters required to connect to a Kafka instance in {product}. This process is called __service binding__.

This guide describes how to perform service binding. The Kubernetes platform referred to in the remainder of this guide is Red Hat OpenShift.
