// Purpose statement for the assembly
[role="_abstract"]
As a developer of applications and services, you can connect Node.js applications to Kafka instances in {product-long}. https://nodejs.org/en/about/[Node.js^] is a server-side JavaScript runtime that is designed to build scalable network applications. Node.js provides an I/O model that is based on events and non-blocking operations, which enables efficient applications.

.Prerequisites
ifndef::community[]
* You have a Red Hat account.
endif::[]
* You have a Kafka instance in {product} and the instance is in the *Ready* state. To learn how to create a Kafka instance, see link:{base-url}{getting-started-url}[Getting started with {product-long}].
* https://github.com/git-guides/[Git^] is installed.
* You have an IDE such as https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/[IntelliJ IDEA^], https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/[Eclipse^], or https://code.visualstudio.com/Download[VSCode^].
* https://nodejs.org/en/download/[Node.js 14^] is installed. The https://github.com/blizzard/node-rdkafka[node-rdkafka^] client can't run on later versions.

[NOTE]
====
The example Node.js application in this quick start uses the https://kafka.js.org/[KafkaJS^] client by default. If you want to use the https://github.com/blizzard/node-rdkafka[node-rdkafka^] client, you must install some development tools locally on your computer, or use Docker to run a specified container image and configure a development environment. To learn more, see the https://github.com/nodeshift-starters/reactive-example/tree/node-rdkafka#node-rdkafka-and-kafkajs[documentation] for the example Node.js application.
====

// Condition out QS-only content so that it doesn't appear in docs.
// All QS anchor IDs must be in this alternate anchor ID format `[#anchor-id]` because the ascii splitter relies on the other format `[id="anchor-id"]` to generate module files.
